%%%%%% NOTE FROM OVERLEAF: The mathtime package is no longer publicly available nor distributed. We recommend using a different font package e.g. mathptmx if you'd like to use a Times font.
% \usepackage{mathptmx}

% The mathtime package uses a Times font instead of Computer Modern.
% Uncomment the line below if you wish to use the mathtime package:
%\usepackage[cmbold]{mathtime}
% Note that miktex, by default, configures the mathtime package to use commercial fonts
% which you may not have. If you would like to use mathtime but you are seeing error
% messages about missing fonts (mtex.pfb, mtsy.pfb, or rmtmi.pfb) then please see
% the technical support document at http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf
% for instructions on fixing this problem.

% Note: you may use either harvard or natbib (but not both) to provide a wider
% variety of citation commands than latex supports natively. See below.

% Uncomment the next line to use the natbib package with bibtex 
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{acronym}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Greater transparency for all data underlying AEA articles, including confidential data, while systematically incorporating third-party repositories
	\item Greater reliability of computations where possible
\end{itemize}

\section{Key points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Work on an improved ``Data and Code Availability Policy'', associated infrastructure, and guidance is progressing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item New policy plus interpretation drafted
		\item Draft guidance available
		\item Infrastructure = data and code repository: contract being negotiated, technical improvements planned
		\item Infrastructure = better metadata about where data and code are stored: developed, user interface being developed
		\item Infrastructure = undergraduate lab, augmented with graduate students, tasked with pre-acceptance verification is working
	\end{itemize}
	\item Working selectively with a few editors on pre-publication (pre-acceptance) assessments (primarily AEJ:Policy at this point)
	\item Issues in migration /future deposits:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Historical archives need to be put under a license appropriate for data and code (no current license; copyright retained)
		\item Future deposits need a default license, and acceptable alternate licenses
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The new ``AEA Data and Code Repository'' will be made available to new submissions, and historical submissions migrated, in 2019Q2/2019Q3.
	\item The Data Editor, in coordination with the Secretary and the Editors, will disseminate and start implementing the new ``Data and Code Availability Policy''
	\item The Data Editor, in coordination with the Secretary and legal Counsel, will determine an appropriate set of licenses for own (``AEA Data and Code Repository'') and third-party repositories
	\item Enhanced but user-friendly metadata will identify locations, persistence, and licenses of all data and code 
	\item Scaling pre-acceptance verification to more journals, using non-Cornell students
\end{itemize}



\section{Action items for the EC}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[ACTION:] The EC is \textbf{requested to approve}: All historical archives shall be licenses   under a mixed open-source license (CC-BY 4.0 for databases and text,  modified BSD for  code). This is a change to the overall policy of the AEA as to intellectual property.
	\item[Notes:]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}{Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY 4.0} is the gold-standard for open licenses, allowing all re-use, without conditions other than attribution (citing). Other licenses impose restrictions - ShareAlike, Non-Commercial, Non-Derivative. 
	    \item Absence of license means that re-use is not approved in general, every re-use would require the AEA to provide permission. In theory, all replication attempts currently are ``unauthorized'' in the absence of a license
	    \item The Creative Commons organization itself suggests NOT to use CC licenses for software
	    \item \href{https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause}{Modified BSD license} is the suggested license for open re-use of software (code), but others are also acceptable (as per \url{https://opensource.org/licenses}). 
	\end{itemize}
	\item[ACTION:] The EC is \textbf{requested to approve}: All future supplements in the hosted repository shall have \textbf{(a)} copyright by the authors, not the AEA \textbf{(b)} requirement to make databases available under some open license sufficient for replication, and \textbf{(c)}  all code available under an open-source license sufficient to allow for replication
	\item[Notes:]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a change for the AEA in terms of who holds the copyright
		\item It is in line with best practices for replicable science
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
