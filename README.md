# Interim report by the Data Editor 2018 mid-year

The main directory is the paper. It is also accessible through Overleaf.

Programs are in the [programs](programs/) directory, because there actually is a bit of data in this report.

Data sourced directly from elsewhere can be found in [data/original](data/original), with the sources to pull the data down in the programs. 

All figures and tables created by the programs are written to [includes](includes/), from where the LaTeX picks them up.
