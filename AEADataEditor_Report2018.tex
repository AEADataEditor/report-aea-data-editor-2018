%%%%%% NOTE FROM OVERLEAF: The mathtime package is no longer publicly available nor distributed. We recommend using a different font package e.g. mathptmx if you'd like to use a Times font.
% \usepackage{mathptmx}

% The mathtime package uses a Times font instead of Computer Modern.
% Uncomment the line below if you wish to use the mathtime package:
%\usepackage[cmbold]{mathtime}
% Note that miktex, by default, configures the mathtime package to use commercial fonts
% which you may not have. If you would like to use mathtime but you are seeing error
% messages about missing fonts (mtex.pfb, mtsy.pfb, or rmtmi.pfb) then please see
% the technical support document at http://www.aeaweb.org/templates/technical_support.pdf
% for instructions on fixing this problem.

% Note: you may use either harvard or natbib (but not both) to provide a wider
% variety of citation commands than latex supports natively. See below.

% Uncomment the next line to use the natbib package with bibtex 
\usepackage{natbib}
\usepackage{hyperref}
% Uncomment the next line to use the harvard package with bibtex
%\usepackage[abbr]{harvard}

% This command determines the leading (vertical space between lines) in draft mode
% with 1.5 corresponding to "double" spacing.

\maketitle
The purpose of scientific publishing is the dissemination of robust research findings, exposing them to the scrutiny of peers. Key to this endeavor is documenting the provenance of those findings. For empirical articles, the foundations on which they reside are external to the article, and often to the journal, in which they are published. Our scientific community faces  increasingly complex issues of privacy and confidentiality that prevent “open” access to those same sources. In consequence, there is a need to properly cite the digital inputs to our published output and to properly curate those inputs.  

Many scientists,  journals, learned societies, and funding agencies have called for greater transparency of research practices, and more assurance that published research is reproducible \citep{Stodden2016-uc,Fuentes2016-wz,Moffitt2016-wl,Camerer2016-kl,Bollen2015-vb,Joskow2015-hd}. This has lead to a focus on transparent access to research data and code \citep{Coffman2017-si,Hoeffler2017-aa,Duvendack2017-js,Hamermesh2017-kq}. 

The AEA's data and code posting policy \citep{American_Economic_Association2008-az}, as well as that of other societies and journals, are intended to create a minimal framework from which to replicate empirical findings. Many partial solutions have been implemented. Journals have implemented verification of submitted code and data during the editorial process,%
\footnote{The American Journal of Political Science outsources this activity to the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science (CITE). The Journal of the American Statistical Association performs a "broad evaluation of quality and potential for usability of the code and data" since 2016 \citep{Stodden2016-uc}.}
highlight the verification on data archives \citep{Open_Science_Framework2017-zc}, maintain lists of acceptable third-party repositories,%
\footnote{Nature Scientific Data maintains a list for its journals \citep{Nature_Scientific_Data2016-hl}, and other institutions (CoreTrustSeal, FAIRsharing) have as their primary purpose to perform this kind of vetting.} 
and interlink with collaborating repositories to highlight authors' (and repositories') contributions to the data component of a scholarly work.%
\footnote{Elsevier interlinks, for instance, with ICPSR, highlighting the use of a repository on the article's web page.}
Outside of journals, several projects are working to educate the community to incorporate principles of replicability and traceability into their workflow.%
\footnote{P}Open Science Framework, Project TIER, BITSS are just a few of those active in that field \citep{Gentzkow2014-va,Wilson2016-bt}.
No journal currently does, in my opinion, an adequate job of providing information about restricted-access data, in part because most restricted-access data centers cannot provide structured information about existence, modalities of access, or even data landing pages.%
\footnote{Restricted-access data hosted on ICPSR and possibly Harvard Dataverse are notable exceptions. On the journal side, Elsevier journals have experimented with "Data Descriptions", but while the form is machine-readable, it is essentially free-form text, and checking the box "confidential data" essentially stops the process of filling in any information.} 
None of these solutions are widespread, and standards are only now being developed.

\section{Data Citations}
Properly referencing data goes beyond just reproducibility - it is also proper scientific writing style. In the same way that we use bibliographic references to ``printed'' resources, we should also be using such references for data resources, to give and receive credit where credit is due. Not referencing an article or book is at best an oversight, and at worst plagiarism - and the same should apply to data objects. Numerous guides and tutorials exist (ICPSR, Force11, \cite{dataone-l09}).

The AEA uses the Chicago style for citations and bibliographies \citep{aeadatarefs}. However, the Chicago Style Manual (REF) does not provide examples for data citations, and neither does the Citeproc database used by applications like Zotero (REF) and Mendeley (REF).

DataONE \citep{dataone-cite} suggests content and style that resemble the generic working paper or article citation style (adapted to Chicago style):
\begin{quote}
    Westbrook JW, Kitajima K, Burleigh JG, Kress WJ, Erickson DL, Wright SJ (2011) Data from: What makes a leaf tough? Patterns of correlated evolution between leaf toughness traits and demographic rates among 197 shade-tolerant woody species in a neotropical forest. Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8525
\end{quote}
ICPSR \citep{icpsr-data-cite} notes  that a citation should include the following items:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Title
    \item   Author
    \item   Date
    \item   Version
    \item   Persistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)
\end{itemize}
and provides a few examples, with some additional modifiers:
\begin{quote}
    Esther Duflo; Rohini Pande, 2006, ``Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and Malaria Incidence in India'', http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g== Murray Research Archive [Distributor] V2 [Version]
\end{quote}
Finally, the AEA style guide \citep{aeadatarefs} suggests
\begin{quote}
    Leiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.'' 
    Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. 
    ICPSR05404-v1. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).
\end{quote}

For users of BibTex, a generic database entry might look like
\begin{verbatim}
@techreport{duflopande2006,
author = {Esther Duflo and Rohini Pande}, 
year = 2006, 
title = {Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and Malaria Incidence in India},
howpublished = {},
institution = {Murray Research Archive [Distributor]},
note = {\url{http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g==} V2 [Version]}
}
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
@techreport{leiss1999,
author = {Leiss, Amelia},
year = {1999},
title = {Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968},
institution = {Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research}, 
address = {Ann Arbor, MI},
note = {ICPSR05404-v1. DOI:  10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).},
doi = {10.3886/ICPSR05404},
}
\end{verbatim}
and thus generate ``\cite{duflopande2006}'' and ``\cite{leiss1999}'' and the bibliographic entry in the References.
