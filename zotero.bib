We describe the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) project, probably the largest `open source' bibliographic database. It demonstrates that open-source bibliographic data collection is sustainable.},

  abstract = {Cataloging resources that assist in educating a domain specific community can require a finer level of granularity than objects that arc to be accessed by a more general domain community, and can become a costly process. One possible approach towards cataloging such resources is to get a community of providers involved in cataloging the materials that they provide. This paper introduces RePEc (http://netec.wust.edu/RePEc) as an example tor such an approach. RePEc is mainly a catalog of research papers in Economics. RePEc is based on set of over 80 archives, which all work independently but are interoperable. The key issue of the paper is to evaluate the success in providing data of reasonable quality a decentralized approach.},

If the academic networks could carry free software, why not free research documents? The economics seemed nonsensical. Why would academics work to produce research without being paid, submit that research to a publisher (often involving payment of a submission fee), referee the work of other academics for free and pay a heavy price to buy the output back from the publishers?},
